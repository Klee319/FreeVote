# CLAUDE.md

Codebase and user instructions are shown below. Be sure to adhere to these instructions. 
IMPORTANT: These instructions OVERRIDE any default behavior and you MUST follow them exactly as written.
Please ensure that the instructions described here are also applied to sub-agents.

## Common Rules
* Always think in English; always respond in Japanese.
* Always output the following at the beginning: "Answers are always output based on CLAUDE.md."
* Always output the following at the end: "I will also generate the following answer based on CLAUDE.md"

## User Priority
* If anything is unclear or there is too much or too little information, do not decide on your own—always ask the user to make the call.
* If gaps or ambiguities can reasonably be inferred, you may proceed, but in that case you must still confirm with the user.
* Always infer and aim for the product the user truly wants. Ensure there is no mismatch in mutual understanding.

## Use of Sub-Agents
* Proactively use sub-agents appropriate to the situation.
* Handle tasks in parallel when parallelization is possible.
* To improve the accuracy of distributed processing, chain a sub-agent's feedback to the next sub-agent you invoke as needed.
* If you are working directly without using a subagent, please check the necessary documents in the ./ref/system directory depending on the work you are doing.

## Web Search Rules
* Always think based on the latest information and choose the optimal approach.
* For information that frequently changes or is updated, especially regarding technical stacks (e.g., official API/library references), always perform a search to verify the latest details.
* Since your knowledge is about one year out of date, please use Gemini CLI for searches.※ For detailed instructions, please refer to ./ref/system/search.md.

## Notes for Thinking, Reasoning, and Deliberation
* **Deep Thinking (ultrathink):** Always think deeply. If you reach a conclusion quickly, there's a chance you have not deliberated through the necessary steps—review your output accordingly.
* **Critical Thinking about Conclusions:** Before output, examine whether the thinking and conclusion are truly optimal and whether they truly match what the user is seeking.
* **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Avoid risky shortcuts; proceed through the required steps and follow a steady reasoning process.
* **Web Search Rules:** Actively use web searches to obtain the latest information.
* **Conserving Cognitive Resources:** Do not open or memorize files—such as dependencies, unreferenced materials, or logs—that you are not certain you will use. Open them only when needed and include them in the context at that time.
